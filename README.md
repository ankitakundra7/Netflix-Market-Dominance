In this project, we tried to explore if Netflix is beginning to lose its dominance in the streaming services industry through the analysis of user comments on social media. Netflix's streaming services was launched in 2007 and is one of the oldest. This first-mover advantage has helped to ensure its overwhelming dominance in the streaming servies industry for over a decade now. However over the past few years, other streaming platforms such as hulu, hbomax, paramount etc are on the rise. In the first quarter of 2021, Netflix reported the addition of four million new customers which was considerably below the forecasted six million. In this project, we analyze the comments on social media to understand if there is a shift in sentiment towards Netflix viz-a-viz other streaming services and identify the possible reasons for it.

We scrapped 185,000 comments dating from Jan' 2020 to Oct' 2021 from subreddit r/CordCutters for this purpose. r/CordCutters is a discussion platform for live streaming and on demand services like Roku, Netflix, Hulu, Amazon, and YouTube TV. We also scrapped comments on Netflix shows on IMDb.

We began our analysis by cleaning the data and removing stopwords, punctuations etc. We also replaced 

This overcoming of dominance of other streaming services may eventually impact Netflix itself and also its subscribers as well and since they may want to improve their streaming in order to stay on trend with their competitors
This problem can also impact competitors and can affect their subscribers as well and competitors can learn from Netflix’s techniques on how to be more attractive to subscribers by improving their own content and giving them more of an edge



Left: Sentiment scores for all the platforms are positive from 0.24 to 0.41, so we concluded that there are no significant insights that we can draw from the table.
So we decided to dive deeper into this analysis by, instead of looking at the magnitude of the sentiments, to look at the proportion of negative and positive comments out of the comments that mention only each platform. We discovered that Netflix came second place for the proportion of negative comments.

We also conducted sentiment analysis of the attributes for each platform and almost all the sentiments were positive.
Out of all the attributes, the proportion of negative comments of Netflix are relatively high for the ‘Family’ and ‘Original’ attributes. Each of these tables show the top 3 platforms with higher negative comments.
Family
In the earlier Topic modeling slides, we found that ‘dark’ was included in the ‘content’ topic. From the table, we can see that there are relatively more negative comments about the family attribute. On the other hand, Disney and Hulu are known to be more family-friendly, which we assumed was why they were not included in the top 3. So this shows how there is a chance of Netflix losing certain subscribers to those family-friendlier platforms.
Original
From the table on the right, we can see that netflix ranks 2nd place for the highest proportion of negative comments about original contents. So we looked into the originals of each of the platforms and found out that netflix actually had the greatest number of original contents. The number of more than all the others’ combined. So we wanted to what aspect of the Netflix’s originals showed areas of improvement and this led to our further investigation about the original content of the platforms.
Lastly, how HBO Max and Amazon are commented about the same attributes in a similar way may underline that they are potential competitors.

The original content is one of the most important features in the TV streaming market. Based on the previous analysis, we decided to compare sentiment scores with IMDb rating of the entire original contents of each platform. The overall trend of this relationship seems to be proportional. We could see that Netfilx’s relatively low scores for both IMDB and sentiment. One issue we thought of is that Netflix might be focusing less on the quality of the contents, compared to the quantity of the contents, which is about 4 times more than the sum of all other streaming services’. 1918 vs 523

any other relevant information regarding netflix dominance, concluding statements
Netflix is still one of the most popular platforms , should not rely on their first mover advantage
Focus on quality over quantity in their original content
The attributes are average compared to the competitors. So improving in any of these will be good (live, connection, etc.)
Biggest competitors: HBOMAX and Amazon
Develop Recommendation System for Platforms → beneficial for people!!!!!
