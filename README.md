# Netflix-Market-Dominance

In this project, we tried to explore if Netflix is still dominant in the streaming services industry.

Netflix is one of the oldest streaming companies as it was started in 2007 and the advantages they had before which contributed to their rise may be not be as advantageous now as other companies such as hulu, hbomax, paramount and other streaming platforms are on the rise as well
This overcoming of dominance of other streaming services may eventually impact Netflix itself and also its subscribers as well and since they may want to improve their streaming in order to stay on trend with their competitors
This problem can also impact competitors and can affect their subscribers as well and competitors can learn from Netflixâ€™s techniques on how to be more attractive to subscribers by improving their own content and giving them more of an edge
