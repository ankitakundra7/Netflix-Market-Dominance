In this project, we tried to explore if Netflix is beginning to lose its dominance in the streaming services industry through the analysis of user comments on social media. Netflix's streaming services was launched in 2007 and is one of the oldest. The first-mover advantage has helped to ensure its overwhelming dominance in the streaming servies industry for over a decade now. However over the past few years, other streaming platforms such as hulu, hbomax, paramount etc are on a rise as well.

We scrapped 185,000 comments dating from Jan' 2020 to Oct' 2021 from subreddit r/CordCutters for this purpose. r/CordCutters is a discussion platform for live streaming and on demand services like Roku, Netflix, Hulu, Amazon, and YouTube TV. We also scrapped comments on Netflix shows on IMDb.



This overcoming of dominance of other streaming services may eventually impact Netflix itself and also its subscribers as well and since they may want to improve their streaming in order to stay on trend with their competitors
This problem can also impact competitors and can affect their subscribers as well and competitors can learn from Netflixâ€™s techniques on how to be more attractive to subscribers by improving their own content and giving them more of an edge
